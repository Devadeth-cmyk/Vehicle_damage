inference/repair_estimator.py
Rule-based repair cost estimation, keyed on (part, damage_type, severity).

This is an INDICATIVE estimate based on researched approximate market rates,
not real workshop invoice data (which isn't available for this project) —
state this explicitly in your report, same as the severity heuristic.
The workshop's actual estimate remains authoritative; this only pre-fills
a starting number so the workshop isn't estimating from zero.
